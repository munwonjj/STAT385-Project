# STAT385-Project
So our Shiny-app had 4 main tabs to start with. We had the Information, Discrimination Stats, Monthly Arrest by Crime Category and a tab that predicts how long someone would be in jail depending on various factors.

The Discrimination tab allows users to navigate over different factors through the control panel button. According to a specific factor, we allowed viewers to view the corresponding graph

For the third tab, we created a seasonal graph that reflected monthly arrest by months.

Last tab was our most important section where we created a model that predicted how long someone would stay in jail according to various factors.
